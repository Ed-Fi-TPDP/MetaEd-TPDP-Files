# Entities

The following table describes the primary entities of which the Student Discipline Interchange is composed.  

| Name | Description |
|----------|-----------------|
| DisciplineIncident | This event entity represents an occurrence of an infraction ranging from a minor behavioral problem that disrupts the orderly functioning of a school or classroom (such as tardiness) to a criminal act that results in the involvement of a law enforcement official (such as robbery). A single event (e.g., a fight) is one incident regardless of how many perpetrators or victims are involved. Discipline incidents are events classified as warranting discipline action. |
| StudentDisciplineIncidentAssociation | This association indicates those students who were victims, perpetrators, witnesses, and reporters for a discipline incident. |
| DisciplineAction | This event entity represents actions taken by an education organization after a disruptive event that is recorded as a discipline incident. |
