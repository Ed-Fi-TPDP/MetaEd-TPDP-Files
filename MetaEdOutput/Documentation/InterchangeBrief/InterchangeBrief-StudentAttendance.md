# Student Attendance Interchange

# Overview

The Student Attendance interchange describes student attendance events. It can be used to exchange daily attendance or section-level attendance. It may be used in cases where only absences are reported (attendance is assumed if no absence is reported), or where both attendance and absences are reported.



Like all standard Ed-Fi interchanges, this schema references the Ed-Fi Core XSD and can be extended using the Ed-Fi Extensions Framework. See the [Ed-Fi Data Standard - Developers' Guide] for more information.


# Use Cases

The Student Attendance Interchange can be used to:  

1. Exchange a school's or LEA's section (class), school (daily), intervention, or program attendance data.
    2. Exchange a school's or LEA's section attendance taken data.
    3. Exchange attendance data for a particular student (e.g., for a transfer student).
