# Student Cohort Interchange

# Overview

Cohorts are used to designate groups of students outside of class rosters, enrollment lists, or program participation.

    The Student Cohort interchange describes student cohort information. It can be used to exchange information regarding any named group of students, or cohort, for tracking, analysis, or intervention.



Like all standard Ed-Fi interchanges, this schema references the Ed-Fi Core XSD and can be extended using the Ed-Fi Extensions Framework. See the [Ed-Fi Data Standard - Developers' Guide] for more information.


# Use Cases

The Student Cohort Interchange can be used to:  

1. Exchange students identified for special tracking (e.g., a principal watch list).
    2. Exchange students identified for interventions.
    3. Exchange staff members associated with a cohort who are providing support, services, or sponsorship.
    4. Exchange staff members that are allowed to see specific student records (e.g., therapists and specialists).
