# Education Organization Interchange

# Overview

The Education Organization interchange describes education organizations, their structure, and their education offerings. It is used to exchange education organization information about a state's schools, local education agencies (LEAs), education service centers (ESCs), and others. 

    In addition, the interchange (optionally) supports the definition of the education offerings provided by schools, specifically the available courses and alternative/supplemental programs offered. Courses in this context refer to "course catalog" information. As such, this interchange may define current as well as past courses.

    Locations and ClassPeriods can be re-used across Schools, if they are the same, using LocationReference and ClassPeriodReference within other domain entities in the interchange.


Accountability Ratings can be assigned to a school or LEA through this interchange.


Like all standard Ed-Fi interchanges, this schema references the Ed-Fi Core XSD and can be extended using the Ed-Fi Extensions Framework. See the [Ed-Fi Data Standard - Developers' Guide] for more information.

    2. Exchange new or updated education organization information (e.g., change of address).
    3. Exchange available courses.
